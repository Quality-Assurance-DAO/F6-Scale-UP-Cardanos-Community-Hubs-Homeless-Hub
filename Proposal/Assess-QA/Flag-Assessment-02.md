## The text of the assessments

## Impact - 2.
This is an admirable project but looks more like a charitable/research one. The most important thing, imo, was missed in this proposal. Do these homeless people have a mobile phone or computer which can connect to the internet and make use of the Cardano online platforms such as Ideascale? Do these people have regular access to internet? And finally, why was no work down to identify how blockchain can help these people (eg. generate a consistent income (app for odd jobs), find free lodging, find free food (restaurant app signaling leftover food)) prior to submitting proposal? I think that the $20,000 are better spent on any of the things mentioned above which would make a real difference in their lives. I struggle to see how setting meetings and publishing a report discussing views of society will help these people. In my opinion, not enough ground work has been done and proposal is not able to identify whether the blockchain can help these people.  The creation of a real and long lasting Cardano Homeless community is greatly uncertain. I would suggest that contact with entities dealing with homeless community be made in advance of publishing proposal and made part of the team, especially when proposer declare to have existing ties with these communities. A proposal in fund 7 challenge setting already exists to evaluate whether the community would like to set money aside for charity purposes. If that is accepted, funding can be applied under that challenge.

## Feasibility – 2.
Both proposals are experienced with homelessness and working with homeless communities (amongst others). They declare they already have ties to communities in Manchester. So, I do not understand why at least 1 representative from any of these communities was not consulted to check interest in the proposed project. Bringing a representative from the community and adding him to proposal team on Ideascale shows commitment. Besides, I am sure that this person could have shed more light on the situation and the chance of the proposal being successful. Lack of identification of motivation for homeless people to make part of Cardano was also not listed. Unless there are incentives for the people to on board and stay, they have no reason to do so. The aforementioned shows lack of planning which heavily undermines the success chances of the project to form a Homeless Cardano Community. The proposal seems to be more of funding for a research paper paying homeless people to share their thought and advance the research.  

## Auditability – 2.
Goals of proposal:
-Meetings with homeless people explaining about blockchain
-Compile and publish a report about the findings
It is unclear how these will result in challenge goals of creating a Cardano community Hub. It is hard to audit the success of the proposal especially since retention of any initial  participants is not clear.  On continuation after funding exhaustion proposal states; "empowering participants to take ownership, so that when funding ends, participants have the tools to continue for themselves.". It is unclear how this will be done or what tools will be given knowing that these people are homeless and would rather spend any money on food, clothing or shelter. 


“questions to ask” when deciding whether to challenge (NB this is not a definitive list of the grounds on which we can challenge – it’s just guidance)
•	Is the review given from a biased perspective? 
•	Is it clear that the proposal was not read through by the community advisor? 
•	Is it clear that the selection criteria and review guidelines were not applied or understood by the community advisor? Does the score align with the rationale? 
•	Does review lack clear articulation of the rationale for the assessment in a constructive way? 
•	Does review comply with our community conduct guidelines? 


## My draft explanation
I would like to challenge this assessment from z_assessor_281 on the grounds that the CA 
1.	has not read the proposal all the way through, but only selectively; 
2.	gives a rationale for “auditability” which is not about auditability;  
3.	gives a rationale for “impact” which does not assess the proposal on its own merits
4.	is overall assessing from a biased perspective.

## 1. Not reading the proposal fully:
•	On Auditability, the CA (rather dismissively) says the project’s goals are to “have some meetings...” and “publish a report”. But our ‘measures of success’ clearly outline much wider goals, including participants producing an event or output chosen by them. The CA appears not to have read this.
•	The CA’s key objection on “impact” is that they believe homeless people don’t have Internet access. This is an untrue assumption in our UK context, as the CA would have realised if they had read fully. The proposal states that the project will be delivered “through in-person workshops and online sessions”, making it clear that our target group *do* have Internet access; and our supporting documentation even includes an example of a web-based engagement project with homeless people in the UK. We also explain that we have worked extensively with homeless communities; so it’s reasonable to think we would know if our target community has Internet access. This should be ample information for the CA to realise they have made an incorrect assumption and need to rethink. 
•	The CA asserts we are “paying” homeless people to take part (which would be pretty unethical, so it’s quite a damning assertion). The proposal clearly says we are offering expenses (at under $25 per participant per week, it is hard to understand how anyone could construe this as “paying”.) 

## Rationale for “impact” does not assess the project on its merits
•	On “Impact”, the CA focuses on their own idea for a proposal with homeless people (developing an app to tell people where to get odd jobs and free food), which they feel would be a better project. Leaving aside any discussion of whether that actually *is* a useful idea in our UK context, this cannot be a valid reason to assess a proposal negatively. A CA needs to assess a proposal on its own merits, not on the fact that they have their own idea which they prefer. If this CA has an idea for a proposal about homelessness, great; they should submit it, not use it to downvote someone else’s idea.

## Rationale for “auditability” is not relevant to the question
•	On “auditability”, the rationale given is unrelated to how auditable the project is – it’s mostly a reiteration of the CA’s views on impact/challenge goals.

## Bias
•	The CA  asserts repeatedly that this is a “charitable” proposal, but the proposal contains nothing  to support this – no charitable approach, charitable aims, or charitable outcomes whatsoever. This suggests a bias on the part of the CA that work with homeless people cannot possibly be conducted on an equal, rights-based basis, but must of necessity be “charity”.
•	The CA asserts that the project should have researched a way to use Cardano to help homeless people, and presented this solution to them without consulting them. The CA either has not read, or has chosen not to engage with, our fundamental point that homeless people should  have the chance to define their *own* solutions. This amounts to the CA displaying an ideological bias against inclusive, co-produced work with homeless people, and contradicts widely-accepted best practice in the field – but the CA  doesn’t mention any relevant experience or knowledge that makes them qualified to do this. Just as a CA who disagrees with accepted methodology on a tech-based project would need to show that they have some knowledge and experience on which to base their disagreement, so with any other proposal that involves specialised work. 
•	The CA also repeatedly shows evidence of commonly-held prejudices and media myths about homeless people (that they have no Internet access; that they are unable to do anything except focus on getting food and shelter);  and repeatedly uses dismissive language (“these people”). These biased attitudes seem to be fuelling their assessment.
