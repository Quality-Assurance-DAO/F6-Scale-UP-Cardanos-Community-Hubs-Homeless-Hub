## Final Flagging Version

The CA has not read the proposal fully.  

1) The CA says the project’s goals are to “have some meetings...” and “publish a report”. But our ‘measures of success’ clearly outline much wider goals, including participants producing an event or output chosen by them. 

2) The CA asserts we are “paying” homeless people to take part, but the proposal clearly says we are offering expenses not a wage. 

3) The CA’s key objection on “impact” is that they believe homeless people don’t have Internet access. The proposal states that the project will be delivered “through in-person workshops and online sessions”, making it clear that our target group *do* have Internet access; and our supporting documentation even includes an example of a web-based engagement project with homeless people in the UK. 

4) In “Auditability” the CA states the goal of our proposal as “Meetings with homeless people explaining about blockchain” – we have not said this. The rationale given is unrelated to the issue of auditability; it is mostly a reiteration of the CA’s views on impact. The CA seems to be confusing whether it is possible to audit if something has happened (auditability) with whether they believe something is likely to happen or not.

The CA does not assess the proposal on its own merits. - In “Impact”, the CA focuses on their own idea, their own opinion, for a proposal with homeless people (developing an app to tell people where to get odd jobs and free food), rather than the merits of our proposal.

The CA has not read the proposal and has a bias. - The CA asserts repeatedly that this is a “charitable” proposal, but the proposal contains nothing to support this – no charitable approach, charitable aims, or charitable outcomes whatsoever. This suggests a bias on the part of the CA that work with homeless people must be of a “charitable” nature.
The CA repeatedly shows evidence of commonly held prejudices and media myths about homeless people (that they have no Internet access; that they are unable to do anything except focus on getting food and shelter) and repeatedly uses dismissive language (“these people”). These biased attitudes seem to be fuelling their assessment.
