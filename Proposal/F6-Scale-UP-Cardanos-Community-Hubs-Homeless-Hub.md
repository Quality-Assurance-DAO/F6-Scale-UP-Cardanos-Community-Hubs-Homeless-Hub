## Problem statement :

Homeless people have a unique culture, with much to share on key issues like value / contribution; but Cardano hasn't yet engaged with them.

## Describe your solution to the problem

Introduce the Cardano Community to homeless communities in Manchester, UK, through in-person workshops and online sessions

## Relevant experience

Stephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects.

## Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details

This proposal will initiate a 6-month experiment in communication and understanding between existing Cardano community members and homeless communities in Manchester, UK, which includes a mix of migrant people and UK-born people, and a wide range of levels of ability in English.

We have included money for interpretation where needed, and plan to use and pay people from within the community itself as interpreters.

## Background

Homeless people in developed countries like the United Kingdom form a distinct community, with a culture of its own. This community is a diverse mix of people from different social backgrounds, cultures, migration status and languages.

Due to our lived experience of exclusion, poverty and marginalisation, and due to the fact that, in order to survive, we have to develop networks of mutual aid and support between ourselves, homeless communities often have a perspective on questions of value and contribution that is unique and vital.

This perspective could enrich the Cardano community; and in turn, Cardano could empower homeless people.

The first step in empowering any community to change their lives is to create a space where people can develop and crystallise their OWN understanding of the problem. This might be called community "problem-sensing".

## Problem-Sensing Workshops

A series of weekly workshops will be held with homeless communities in Manchester, UK, working in association with local grassroots organisations.

These workshops will explore questions of value, worth and contribution through the lens of lived experience of homelessness, and will allow time and space for participants to define and articulate problems, and research whether these problems could be addressed using blockchain technology.

Sessions will be documented, and key questions and perspectives that arise in sessions will be fed back to the Cardano community through its various channels (e.g. Discord; Telegram; the Town Hall), thus opening dialogue between the homeless community and the Cardano community, and allowing the homeless group's thinking to begin to have a voice in Cardano.

## Building a community hub

These initial workshops will build confidence, and shared understanding, to enable a group of homeless people to lead a community hub.

This hub will have its roots in the homeless community, but might also engage others locally. We envisage it leading to a public event where homeless people can tell non-homeless locals about blockchain technology and its implications for all of our empowerment.

## What will the project achieve? What would success look like?

### Our measures of success will be: 

- Running 15 sessions will be an achievement in itself. Creating a homeless-led space where people can think and talk about ideas around value, worth, contribution, power, governance and participation in a way that centres their wisdom and experience. Just the fact that there is such a space is valuable in itself.

- The project will be successful if participants feel welcomed in the sessions, and if they know that their contribution is valued and that they have ownership of what the project does. The qualitative aspect of our project evaluation will ask whether this has happened.

 - We also aim for participants to gain confidence in expressing their ideas on these issues, and to enjoy taking part. These are also things that we'll ask participants about in our evaluation.

 - Another measure of success is if participants have the opportunity to become aware of blockchain technology and demystify it a bit. We don't hope to make people experts in 15 weeks!

 - Finally, feeding back to Cardano in a meaningful way would be a key achievement. We want to go further than just a brief presentation at a Town Hall to say yep, the project is happening. We'd like to make space to share the ideas and insights that emerge from the sessions, so that the perspectives of homeless people can influence Cardano's thinking about how to engage communities.

We have to keep in mind that we're aiming to give homeless people space and time to think, research, and develop ideas, not rush them to an output. So even if no big event or product is created at the end, the project will still have been a success if people have engaged with it, learnt from it, and developed their knowledge and confidence. We'd ideally like to develop a future funding proposal led by the group themselves; but this is quite a big deal, and also may not be what the group wants.

## Proposal Team

Stephen Whitenstall (@swhitenstall) has personal experience of homelessness, living in hostels for 5 years between 2004 and 2010. In 2005, with Groundswell UK, Stephen was a founder of "Outside-In" a homeless user involvement group in St Mungo's (The largest homeless charity in London). He helped design a peer facilitation training programme for use in hostels, led workshops and mentored homeless residents to participate in the planning process of a new Hostel in Kensington and Chelsea (now managed by Look ahead). He also articulated homeless issues to Parliament (ODPM) and the Audit Commission. Stephen gained OSW funding (20k) for and managed the social enterprise of "Crafty Folk "a Homeless Artists Market Stall at Spitalfields, City of London for which he won an award for innovation from Crisis UK (2006). https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-whitenstall-166727210/

Vanessa Cardui (@CallyFromAuron) is a skilled facilitator and project manager, with 20 years' experience of participatory work with communities. She is inspired by her own lived experience of homelessness as a young woman; and has led a wide range of publicly-funded community engagement projects in the UK, working with homeless people, Gypsies and Travellers, refugees and asylum seekers, migrant communities, neurodivergent communities, and working-class urban communities, to explore issues such as heritage, sense of place, money and value, and access to public space and resources. A key focus of her practice is the idea of the Archive in marginalised communities â€“ how those of us with experience of social exclusion make decisions on what we value, and preserve it for posterity. For example, see The National Archives Of The Republic Of The Homeless, a 2019 project with homeless and ex-homeless artists in Hull, England: https://homeless.omeka.net
