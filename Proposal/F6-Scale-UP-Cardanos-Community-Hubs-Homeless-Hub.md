### How we are addressing the challenge question

This proposal will initiate a 6-month experiment in communication and understanding between existing Cardano community members, and homeless communities in Manchester, UK. 

Homeless people in the UK come from a diverse mix of social backgrounds, cultures, migration status and languages; but due to their homelessness, they form a distinct community, with a sub-culture of its own. Due to their lived experience of exclusion, poverty and marginalisation, and due to the fact that in order to survive they have to develop networks of mutual aid and support between themselves they often have a perspective on questions of value and contribution that is unique and vital. We believe this perspective could enrich the Cardano community; and in turn, Cardano could empower homeless people. By inviting homeless people to engage with Cardano from where they are, using the perspective of their own community and its culture, and by using facilitators who have their own lived experience of homelessness, we are addressing the challenge's key focus on enabling people to bring their own cultural understanding to Cardano. "Cultural understanding" is about more than the culture of a country or language – it can also be about shared experiences of exclusion.

The people our project will reach are unlikely to have any blockchain expertise, although they may have some tech skills. So we are addressing the challenge question's focus on reaching people on the ground who do not already know about blockchain. And because the UK homeless community includes a mix of migrant people and UK-born people, and a wide range of levels of ability in English, our project also addresses the challenge's focus on engaging people in their own language. Our budget includes money for interpretation where needed, and we plan to use and pay people from within the community itself as interpreters.

The first step in empowering any community to change their lives is to create a space where people can develop and crystallise their OWN understanding of the problem. This might be called community "problem-sensing". By making space for this, our project addresses the challenge's focus on enabling everyone to participate to the best of their ability.

## Problem-Sensing Workshops

A series of weekly workshops will be held with homeless communities in Manchester, UK, working in association with local grassroots organisations.

These workshops will explore questions of value, worth and contribution through the lens of lived experience of homelessness, and will allow time and space for participants to define and articulate problems, and research whether these problems could be addressed using blockchain technology.

Sessions will be documented, and key questions and perspectives that arise in sessions will be fed back to the Cardano community through its various channels (e.g. Discord; Telegram; the Town Hall), thus opening dialogue between the homeless community and the Cardano community, and allowing the homeless group's thinking to begin to have a voice in Cardano.

## Building a community hub

These initial workshops will build confidence, and shared understanding, to enable a group of homeless people to lead a community hub.

This hub will have its roots in the homeless community, but might also engage others locally. We envisage it leading to a public event where homeless people can tell non-homeless locals about blockchain technology and its implications for all of our empowerment.

## What will the project achieve? What would success look like?

### Our measures of success will be: 

- Running 15 sessions will be an achievement in itself. Creating a homeless-led space where people can think and talk about ideas around value, worth, contribution, power, governance and participation in a way that centres their wisdom and experience. Just the fact that there is such a space is valuable in itself.

- The project will be successful if participants feel welcomed in the sessions, and if they know that their contribution is valued and that they have ownership of what the project does. The qualitative aspect of our project evaluation will ask whether this has happened.

 - We also aim for participants to gain confidence in expressing their ideas on these issues, and to enjoy taking part. These are also things that we'll ask participants about in our evaluation.

 - Another measure of success is if participants have the opportunity to become aware of blockchain technology and demystify it a bit. We don't hope to make people experts in 15 weeks!

 - Finally, feeding back to Cardano in a meaningful way would be a key achievement. We want to go further than just a brief presentation at a Town Hall to say yep, the project is happening. We'd like to make space to share the ideas and insights that emerge from the sessions, so that the perspectives of homeless people can influence Cardano's thinking about how to engage communities.

We have to keep in mind that we're aiming to give homeless people space and time to think, research, and develop ideas, not rush them to an output. So even if no big event or product is created at the end, the project will still have been a success if people have engaged with it, learnt from it, and developed their knowledge and confidence. We'd ideally like to develop a future funding proposal led by the group themselves; but this is quite a big deal, and also may not be what the group wants.

## Proposal Team

Stephen Whitenstall (@swhitenstall) has personal experience of homelessness, living in hostels for 5 years between 2004 and 2010. In 2005, with Groundswell UK, Stephen was a founder of "Outside-In" a homeless user involvement group in St Mungo's (The largest homeless charity in London). He helped design a peer facilitation training programme for use in hostels, led workshops and mentored homeless residents to participate in the planning process of a new Hostel in Kensington and Chelsea (now managed by Look ahead). He also articulated homeless issues to Parliament (ODPM) and the Audit Commission. Stephen gained OSW funding (20k) for and managed the social enterprise of "Crafty Folk "a Homeless Artists Market Stall at Spitalfields, City of London for which he won an award for innovation from Crisis UK (2006). https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-whitenstall-166727210/

Vanessa Cardui (@CallyFromAuron) is a skilled facilitator and project manager, with 20 years' experience of participatory work with communities. She is inspired by her own lived experience of homelessness as a young woman; and has led a wide range of publicly-funded community engagement projects in the UK, working with homeless people, Gypsies and Travellers, refugees and asylum seekers, migrant communities, neurodivergent communities, and working-class urban communities, to explore issues such as heritage, sense of place, money and value, and access to public space and resources. A key focus of her practice is the idea of the Archive in marginalised communities – how those of us with experience of social exclusion make decisions on what we value, and preserve it for posterity. For example, see The National Archives Of The Republic Of The Homeless, a 2019 project with homeless and ex-homeless artists in Hull, England: https://homeless.omeka.net

## How this proposal impacts the challenge metrics

### How many new Hubs were launched in the next 6 months?

Our proposal is going to set up one new hub.

### How many new users of Cardano were onboarded?

The project will directly reach 10 participants from the homeless community, who will be onboarded into Cardano. Additionally, the project will attract wider attention, and we aim to onboard 10 additional people, both from the local community where we are working, and among organisations and projects that engage homeless people in the UK.

### What was the total reach of the Hub's initial marketing launch?

Initially (October to December 2021) we will be recruiting homeless participants to work on creating the Hub. The actual marketing launch will happen in April 2022 via social media, live publicity materials distributed locally, word-of-mouth, and possibly a public event; we aim to reach c. 1,000 people with our marketing.

### How many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?

The project will draw its participants from 3 organisations working with homeless people in Manchester, UK, so these organisations will therefore be aware of the Cardano ecosystem. During the course of the project, we aim to conduct outreach to 3 additional community organisations in the local area (such as tenants' groups, parents' groups, etc), and bring them into the Cardano ecosystem via social media engagement with our project, raised awareness of Cardano, and offering the opportunity to join Catalyst workshops and events such as Town Halls.
