## Problem statement :

Homeless people have a unique culture, with much to share on key issues like value / contribution; but Cardano hasn't yet engaged with them.

## Describe your solution to the problem

Introduce the Cardano Community to homeless communities in Manchester, UK, through in-person workshops and online sessions

## Relevant experience

Stephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects.

## Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details

This proposal will initiate a 6-month experiment in communication and understanding between existing Cardano community members and homeless communities in Manchester, UK, which includes a mix of migrant people and UK-born people, and a wide range of levels of ability in English.

We have included money for interpretation where needed, and plan to use and pay people from within the community itself as interpreters.

### Background

Homeless people in developed countries like the United Kingdom form a distinct community, with a culture of its own. This community is a diverse mix of people from different social backgrounds, cultures, migration status and languages.

Due to our lived experience of exclusion, poverty and marginalisation, and due to the fact that, in order to survive, we have to develop networks of mutual aid and support between ourselves, homeless communities often have a perspective on questions of value and contribution that is unique and vital.

This perspective could enrich the Cardano community; and in turn, Cardano could empower homeless people.

The first step in empowering any community to change their lives is to create a space where people can develop and crystallise their OWN understanding of the problem. This might be called community "problem-sensing".

### Problem-Sensing Workshops

A series of weekly workshops will be held with homeless communities in Manchester, UK, working in association with local grassroots organisations.

These workshops will explore questions of value, worth and contribution through the lens of lived experience of homelessness, and will allow time and space for participants to define and articulate problems, and research whether these problems could be addressed using blockchain technology.

Sessions will be documented, and key questions and perspectives that arise in sessions will be fed back to the Cardano community through its various channels (e.g. Discord; Telegram; the Town Hall), thus opening dialogue between the homeless community and the Cardano community, and allowing the homeless group's thinking to begin to have a voice in Cardano.

### Building a community hub

These initial workshops will build confidence, and shared understanding, to enable a group of homeless people to lead a community hub.

This hub will have its roots in the homeless community, but might also engage others locally. We envisage it leading to a public event where homeless people can tell non-homeless locals about blockchain technology and its implications for all of our empowerment.
